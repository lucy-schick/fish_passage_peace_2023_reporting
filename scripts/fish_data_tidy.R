#combining pit tag data to individual fish data so that we can copy and paste directly into submission template
# would be good to include the comments and times/camera of photos in the fish csv and then paste them to the right of the pit tag.

# for that reason the call to read_csv needs to be different (change col_names to F for that file). W
