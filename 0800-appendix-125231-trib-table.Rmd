# Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix {-}

## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing 125231 is located on a tributary to the Table River near the 21km mark of the Chuchinka-Table FSR. The
culverts are located 0.7km from the confluence of the Table River and approximately 200m upstream of a CN Railway
culvert (PSCIS 197493 - discussed below). Canfor Corporation are the primary forest licensee at this location with the
Ministry of Forests as the road tenure holders.

<br>

The site was originally prioritized for replacement in @irvine2020ParsnipRiver, following a habitat confirmation assessment
which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125231.html).

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

The subject stream flows in a southern direction into the Table River at a point 7.9 km upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, the tributary to the Table River is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |> english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125231)). 

<br>

PSCIS crossing 197493 is located on the CN Railway approximately 200m downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR where
replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is planned.  At the time of assessments conducted in both 2019 and 2022, 
the fully embedded culvert was considered passable according to provincial metrics [@moe2011]. A recently installed bridge (PSCIS 197499) is located approximately 450m upstream of the crossing and there are no other 
anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage upstream.

<br>

Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded
[@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-125231). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

<br>

In the summer of 2024, crossing `r my_site` was replaced with a clear-span bridge by Canfor with environmental oversight and engineering from DWB Consulting Services Ltd. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc.

## Fish Sampling {-}

A total six sites were sampled in the vicinity of crossing 125231 with three sites located upstream and three sites located downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125231) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125231) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125231). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-d01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-d02)."))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

## Monitoring 

In September 2024, the site was assessed for monitoring purposes, with results summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tab-monitoring-125231). The structure was well-designed to fit the stream channel, with minimal rock placement in areas likely to be within the natural channel and without constricting flow. However, there appeared to be no planting of riparian vegetation within the construction footprint, and no salvaged material had been replanted elsewhere. The structure appeared stable with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Electrofishing was performed upstream and downstream, with results summarised in the section below.


```{r tab-monitoring-125231}
tab_monitoring |> 
  dplyr::filter(`Pscis Crossing Id` == my_site) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) |> 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),  # Select all columns
    names_to = "variable",  # Column names become values in this column
    values_to = "value"  # Data values go into this column
  ) |> 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of monitoring metric results for site ', my_site, '.'),
                                       scroll = gitbook_on)
```

## Conclusion

PSCIS crossing  `r my_site` offered a relatively rare opportunity in the Table River
watershed to remediate fish passage on a forest service road due to the downstream PSCIS crossing 197493 being fully embedded and passable in both 2019 and 2022, and passage was not also impeded by a CN Railway structure. Although the stream is smaller in size, it is located within an area designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed with habitat
presence suitable for bull trout (Western Arctic population) which has been assessed by the Committee on the Status 
of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern [@beaudry2014Assessmentassignmentb; @cosewic2012COSEWICassessmenta].

<br>

Restoration of fish passage at crossing `r my_site` was restored in the summer of 2024 with a clear-span bridge by Canfor with environmental oversight and engineering from DWB Consulting Services Ltd. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. Replacement of the crossing will provide access to habitat blocked to upstream migrating fish for likely 10 - 20
years (timeline depending on the rate of down cutting caused by the outlet drops) and the stream has no other anthropogenic
obstructions to fish passage. The presence of burbot in the system is of particular interest as this fish provides good
food values and in general, compared to numerous other species (ex. steelhead and coho), burbot are documented as less
capable swimmers considering time-to-fatigue versus swim speed [@katopodis_gervais2016Fishswimming]. 

In 2023, the presence of
burbot downstream of the crossing and absence in sample sites above could indicate that the crossing was preventing some
migration of this species however sample areas were small and the habitat presence/preference may have been more a
determinant of presence than the passability of the crossing.

<br>

Resampling of fish at the site in future years of the project is recommended to build our understanding of fish use,
movement and health in the stream providing valuable data for monitoring the effectiveness of crossing replacement.
Additionally, acquisition of aerial imagery following structure replacement is recommended so that aerial imagery and 3D
models generated from the data can be compared to products generated from data gathered in 2023. These comparisons will
be useful for communications related to the project as well as for providing insight into changes in stream morphology,
effectiveness of environmental management plans and site rehabilitation efforts following construction.
