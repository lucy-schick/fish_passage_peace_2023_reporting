# Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix {-}

## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing 125231 is located on a tributary to the Table River near the 21km mark of the Chuchinka-Table FSR. The
culverts are located 0.7km from the confluence of the Table River and approximately 200m upstream of a CN Railway
culvert (PSCIS 197493 - discussed below). Canfor Forest Products Ltd. are the primary forest licensee at this location with the
Ministry of Forests as the road tenure holder.


## Background {.unnumbered}

The site was originally prioritized for replacement in @irvine2020ParsnipRiver, following a habitat confirmation assessment which can be found   [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125231.html).  Follow up work was conducted in the summer of 2023 which included fish sampling and tagging with pit tags. In the summer of 2024, crossing `r my_site` was replaced with a 12m steel girder/timber deck clear-span bridge by Canfor with environmental oversight and engineering from DWB Consulting Services Ltd. Site design plans can be found [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/inputs_raw/125231_design.pdf) with a construction monitoring report [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/inputs_raw/125231_construction_report.pdf) [@dwbconsultingservicesltd_2024Postconstruction]. Partial funding for the project was provided by FWCP through coordination from SERNbc. During fish salvage activities prior to construction DWB scanned captured fish for PIT tags. Additionally, following replacement of the structure SERNbc and McLeod Lake field crews revisited the site to conduct follow up sampling and effectiveness monitoring.  This memo has been updated to reflect the work conducted in 2024.


<br>

The subject stream flows in a southern direction into the Table River at a point 7.9 km upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River. At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, the tributary to the Table River is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |> english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125231)). 

<br>



PSCIS crossing 197493 is located on the CN Railway approximately 200m downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR where
replacement of PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is planned.  At the time of assessments conducted in both 2019 and 2022, 
the fully embedded railway culvert was considered passable according to provincial metrics [@moe2011]. A recently installed bridge (PSCIS 197499) is located approximately 450m upstream of the crossing and there are no other 
anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage upstream.

<br>

Upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded
[@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC] and DWB reporting captured of a bull trout just downstream of the crossing during salvage activities. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-125231). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).

## Effectiveness Monitoring {.unnumbered}

In September 2024, effectiveness monitoring was conducted at the site, with results summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tab-monitoring-125231). Overall, assessments indicate that the structure was well-designed to fit the stream channel, with minimal rock placement within the natural channel and un-constricted flows. The structure appeared stable with no maintenance required at the time of reporting. Recommendations to be implemented at future remediation sites include the planting of nursery grown and salvaged vegetation within the construction footprint where riparian vegetation was removed to accommodate construction.
Photos showing a comparison of the culvert assessment conducted in 2020 versus the completed bridge construction in 2024 are presented in [the 2020 report](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/03_Parsnip_report_125231.html) and in Figure \@ref(fig:photo-125231-05). 

<br>


Aerial imagery surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft and the resulting images were stitched into orthomosaics. Imagery from before the bridge replacement in 2023 is `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(" presented in Figures \\@ref(fig:ortho-caption-125231-before) - \\@ref(fig:model-caption-125231-before),")} else knitr::asis_output("presented [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/ae73e230851242d882c5cd77fec97635) and [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/ae73e230851242d882c5cd77fec97635/), ")` and after the replacement in 2024 is

## Fish Sampling {-}

Fish sampling was conducted in 2023 before the crossing was replaced, during the pre-construction salvage (by DWB) and in 2024 after the bridge was constructed. 

<br>

In 2023, a total six sites were sampled in the vicinity of crossing 125231 with three sites located upstream and three sites located downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125231) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125231) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125231). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-03)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-d02))"))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

<br>

A PIT tag reader was loaned to DWB during the 2024 pre-construction salvage so that fish captured could be scanned to track health and movement of fish captured during 2023 sampling. Although a total of 23 rainbow trout and one bull trout were caught, no previously tagged fish were captured.  Of interest, the capture of a bull trout downstream of the crossing - is a first for the study stream's watershed and evidence that remediation activities are likely to benefit this species [@dwbconsultingservicesltd_2024Postconstruction].

<br>

In 2024, electrofishing was conducted at two sites downstream and one site upstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. No fish captured had a PIT tag, therefore no fish from 2023 were recaptured. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125231-2024) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125231-2024) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125231-2024). A total of `r tab_fish_summary_2024 %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary_2024 %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` rainbow trout were captured downstream `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-125231-d02))"))` All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/2024_fish_data_tags_joined.csv")`).


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r my_site` on the Chuchinka-Table FSR offered a relatively rare opportunity in the Table River watershed to remediate fish passage on a forest service road, due to the downstream PSCIS crossing 197493 being fully embedded and passable in both 2019 and 2022, and passage was not also impeded by a CN Railway structure. Although the stream is smaller in size, it is located within an area designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed with habitat
presence suitable for bull trout (Western Arctic population) which has been assessed by the Committee on the Status 
of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern and now confirmed as present within the subject stream [@beaudry2014Assessmentassignmentb; @cosewic2012COSEWICassessmenta; @dwbconsultingservicesltd_2024Postconstruction].  

<br>

Resampling of fish at crossing `r my_site` in the future is recommended to build our understanding of fish use, movement and health in the stream. eDNA could be considered as a method to detect bull trout presence upstream of the crossing.  Additionally, future acquisition of aerial imagery or lidar is recommended so that a time series of imagery and 3D
models generated from the data can be compared. These comparisons will
be useful - not only for communications related to the project - but also for providing insight into changes in stream morphology
and vegetation changes following construction. 

<br>

The installation of a clear-span bridge - partially
funded by FWCP - appears to have been very well implemented by Canfor and DWB. Remediation of the site
provides access to valuable habitat previously blocked to upstream migrating fish.
