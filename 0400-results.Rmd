## Communicate Connectivity Issues

We conducted an online presentation through FWCP to showcase the project on February 23, 2024 with over 70 people in 
attendance. A presentation to FWCP Peace board detailing project progress, goals and budgets was also completed on February 6, 2024.

SERNbc and McLeod Lake have been actively engaging with the following groups through numerous meetings, emails and phone
calls to build awareness for the initiative, solicit input, prioritize sites, raise partnership funding and plan/implement 
fish passage remediations: 

  * McLeod Lake Indian Band members of council
  * BCTS Engineering
  * CN Rail
  * Canadian Forest Products (Canfor)
  * Sinclar Forest Projects Ltd. (Sinclar)
  * Northern Engineering - Ministry of Forests
  * BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure
  * Fish Passage Technical Working Group
  * Coastal Gaslink
  * British Columbia Wildlife Federation
  * Planning foresters and biologists from Ministry of Forests and Ministry of Land, Water and Resource Stewardship
  * Fisheries experts
  * University of Northern BC

## Fish Passage Assessments

Field assessments were conducted between `r format(min(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")` and `r format(max(pscis_phase1$date), format="%B %d %Y")`. A total of `r n_distinct(pscis_phase1$my_crossing_reference)` Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included `r pscis_phase1 %>% dplyr::filter(barrier_result == 'Passable') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "passable", `r pscis_phase1 %>% dplyr::filter(barrier_result == 'Potential') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings considered "potential" barriers and `r pscis_phase1 %>% dplyr::filter(barrier_result == 'Barrier') %>% nrow()` crossings considered "barriers" according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length [@fish_passage_assessments]. Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, `r pscis_phase1 %>% dplyr::filter(barrier_result == 'Unknown') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings assessed were fords and ranked as "unknown" according to the provincial protocol. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table \@ref(tab:cost-est-phase-1). Detailed data with photos are presented in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")} else knitr::asis_output("[Attachment 2](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html")`.


<br>

"Barrier" and "Potential Barrier" rankings used in this project followed @fish_passage_assessments and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year [@clarkinNationalInventoryAssessment2005 ;@bellFisheriesHandbookEngineering1991; @thompsonAssessingFishPassage2013]. As noted in @bourne_etal2011Barriersfish, with a detailed review of different criteria in @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates [@bourne_etal2011Barriersfish; @shaw_etal2016Importancepartial; @mahlum_etal2014EvaluatingBarrier; @kemp_ohanley2010Proceduresevaluating].  @washingtondepartmentoffishwildlife2009FishPassage present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.

## Habitat Confirmation Assessments
During 2023 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at `r hab_site_priorities %>% nrow()` sites in the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups.  A total of approximately `r habitat_confirmations_priorities %>% pull(length_surveyed) %>% sum(na.rm = T) %>% round(-3)/1000`km of stream was assessed. Georeferenced field maps are presented in Attachment 1.

<br>

As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.  In total, `r hab_site_priorities %>% dplyr::filter(priority %ilike% 'high') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, `r hab_site_priorities %>% dplyr::filter(priority %ilike% 'Moderate') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and `r hab_site_priorities %>% dplyr::filter(priority %ilike% 'Low') %>% nrow() %>% english::as.english()` crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:map-interactive) and ")}`Tables \@ref(tab:tab-overview) - \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all) with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls).  A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating quantities of bull trout spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-model-all). Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.

## Engineering Design
In 2024, Canfor will replace crossing 125231 (Tributary to Table River) at km21 on the Chuchinka-Table FSR with a
bridge. An engineering design was completed in 2023 with some of the materials purchased for the replacement funded
through this project. More detail on the site is presented in the appendix of this report titled
"Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix".


## Remediations
In 2023, BCTS was able to use our project documentation to provide justification for investments in road deactivation 
leading to the restoration of fish passage at numerous crossings in the Parsnip River watershed including two sites ranked
as priorities as part of habitat confirmation assessments documented in the FWCP funded @irvine2020ParsnipRiver.  

<br>

Crossing 125345, located on a tributary to the Parsnip River, was removed (along with four other culverts) during 
deactivation of approximately 9km of the Chuchinka-Colbourne FSR from Reynolds Creek south to approximately 9km north of
the Anzac River.  The site had been prioritized
in @irvine2020ParsnipRiver with that report available [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/). 

<br>

Crossing 125403, located on a tributary to the Parsnip River, was removed (along with dozens of other culverts) during 
deactivation of approximately 17km of the Hodda FSR.  The site had been prioritized
in @irvine2020ParsnipRiver with that report available [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/). 

## Monitoring

Fish sampling was conducted at a tributary to Table River (PSCIS 125231) Fern Creek (PSCIS 125261) to serve as baseline 
monitoring before structure replacements.  Sampling was planned at a tributary to Missinka River (PSCIS 125179) however
the site was inacessible due to a forest fire in the area.

<br>

Electrofishing was conducted at `r tab_fish_sites_sum %>% n_distinct()` sites with a total of 
`r hab_fish_indiv %>% dplyr::filter(species_code != 'NFC') %>% nrow()` fish captured. Fork length data was used to 
delineate rainbow trout based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (>65 to 110mm), juvenile (>110mm to 140mm) and 
adult (>140mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure \@ref(fig:fish-histogram).  A summary of sites 
assessed are included in Table \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-summary) and raw data is provided in [Attachment 3](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls). 
A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-all). 

<br>

Detailed results for tributary to Table River (PSCIS 125231) are presented in the appendix to this report titled
"Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix".  Results for Fern Creek (PSCIS 125261) are 
presented in "Fern Creek - 125261 - Appendix".

## Challenges and Opportunities {#challenges-opportunities}
### Costs, Timing and Partnerships
Inflation has led to significant cost increases for culvert removals and bridge installations. The projected costs for
replacing culverts with bridges on small streams, on unpaved resource roads, have surged from around \$180,000 in 2020
to over \$400,000 in 2023. These estimates are just a fraction of the costs associated with structure replacements on
railways, highways, and paved roads, which can range from near a million to tens of millions of dollars per crossing.
This challenge poses a significant obstacle without straightforward mitigation. We are actively seeking new funding
partners and are requesting current funders consider increasing financial support for necessary actions.

<br>

Infrastructure replacements and removals, even with full funding secured, are complex, taking several years to plan and
implement, often involving multiple partners with divergent perspectives.  Cost estimates stay uncertain even
post-design, and numerous factors can cause delays or derail plans completely. When financial support depends on annual
renewals with expectations for swift outcomes, planning becomes exceptionally challenging.

<br>

Some landowners and tenure holders lack support to implement remedial actions on the infrastructure they manage,
hindering progress in fish passage restoration efforts. CN Rail infrastructure, in particular, significantly contributes
to fish passage issues in the FWCP Peace Region. However, representatives from the company have communicated that
historically they have been supported to complete one small fish passage remediation project per year across all of
western Canada. We are exploring strategies to encourage collaborative cooperation and investment from these
stakeholders.

<br>

Economic uncertainty in the forestry sector, resulting from deferred cutting permits on land tracks designated as
"old-growth management areas," has significantly impacted our study area. The British Columbia government has urged
licensees to postpone harvesting in these areas until a "new approach for old growth forest management" is developed and
many cutting permits have been on extended hold. Despite initial plans for the remediation of site 125000 near Arctic
Lake in the summer of 2023, our project partner and forest licensee in the area, Sinclar Group, communicated in the
spring of 2023 that road updates were no longer practical due to the deferrals affecting logging plans beyond the
culvert. Consequently, they would not be able to allocate FWCP dollars earmarked for the site from the 2021/2022 or
2022/2023 fiscal funding pots towards the project. Fortunately, we were able to reallocate their funding to Canfor to
catalyze restoration on the Missinka-Table FSR watershed instead.



### Project Complexity and Communication

It is challenging to communicate the complexity of fish passage issues to diverse partners/stakeholders.  Connectivity 
is on a spectrum and is not often 100% or 0% with costs of remediation high. Often there are multiple crossings on the 
same stream with different landowners and tenure holders for each.  We will continue to build relationships and tools 
to help understand and communicate the issues and find ways forward that involve meaningful actions.  

<br>

Collecting and presenting fish passage data poses challenges for field teams due to the large size of study areas, 
arduous field conditions and the complexity of stream crossing and habitat data. To address this, we are developing 
open-source collaborative GIS projects, mobile data collection, and iterative reporting systems to facilitate 
collaboration and share knowledge and methodologies with diverse partners. 

### Complimentary Programs
#### Arctic Grayling Research
Ongoing work in the Parsnip Core area regarding Arctic grayling abundance estimates, critical habitat and spatial ecology
is providing valuable information to inform fish passage restoration efforts.  Consultants and researchers have been
developing multiple programs in the area with the support of the FWCP Peace Region.  We are working together with
these teams to incorporate their findings into our fish passage restoration planning.

#### BCHydro Fish Passage Program
The BC Hydro Fish Passage Program is currently working with First Nations, regulators and stakeholders in the region to 
develop strategies to offset impacts of fish entertainment related to the Peace Canyon and WAC Bennett dams. We met with
West Moberly-DWB Limited Partnership to discuss how our programs can collaborate to identify potential sites for remediation.


#### Climate Change
Climate change is a significant threat to fish and fish habitat.  We are working with the Ministry of Transportation and 
Infrastructure to incorporate climate change risk assessments into our fish passage restoration planning and plan to
continue the evolution of this program into the future.  Additionally, we will utilize climate modelling data to support 
prioritization of crossings (e.g., to support access to cold, drought resistant areas). Progress on this work is underway
with details of some of the work [here](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fish-passage-22), 
[here](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fish-passage-22/issues/12) and 
[here](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/fish-passage-22/issues/13).
