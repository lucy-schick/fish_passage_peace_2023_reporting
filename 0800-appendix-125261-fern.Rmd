# Fern Creek - 125261 - Appendix {-}

## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing 125261 is located on Fern Creek near the 2.1km mark of the Chuchinka-Table FSR approximately 300m upstream
from the confluence with the Parsnip River. Canfor Corporation are forest licensees within the watershed with the Ministry of Forests as the road tenure holder. 

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

The site was originally prioritized for replacement through this project in 2022 - 2023, following a habitat confirmation assessment which can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/) [@irvine_wintersheidt2023SkeenaWatershed]. Originally drafted to record 2023/2024 field activities, this memo has been updated in 2025 with ongoing revisions tracked [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/issues/71).

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-125261)).  Fish species confirmed upstream of the FSR include burbot, rainbow trout, bull trout, sucker, reside shiner, dace and chub [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. A total of `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland are modelled upstream. This includes Fern Lakes, a collection of three lakes that have a combined area of approximately 138ha. The outlet of the first lake in the chain is 3.3km upstream of the FSR.  

<br>

Metal baffles - historically installed within the structure - indicate that there have been fish passage restoration efforts at this crossing in the past.  The pipe appears undersized for the crossing, indicated by downcutting at the outlet and high flow velocities 
within the structure.  Flows appear to be too high for the baffles to retain substrate and function effectively. Although larger fish are 
likely able to ascend through the crossing (depending on size of the fish, swimming ability and flow levels at the time 
of upstream migration) the crossing is still considered a barrier to fish passage and likely blocks migration of all
juvenile life stages at all flows. Crossing characteristics are described in detail [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_peace_2022_reporting/).

<br>


A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-125261). A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "parsnip", archive_date = "2022-05-27")`).


<br>

Canfor procured preliminary engineering designs for a replacement clear-span bridge structure for crossing 125261 through internal Canfor funding. The preliminary design can be viewed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_peace_2023_reporting/blob/main/data/inputs_raw/125261_fern_design.pdf).  The cost of replacement was estimated at \$430,000 however this figure can be considered preliminary and subject to change.

## Fish Sampling {-}
A total six sites were sampled in the vicinity of crossing 125261 with three sites located upstream and three sites located downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-125261) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-125261) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-125261). A total of `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish  were captured upstream, and `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish were captured downstream.  Fish species upstream
included primarily rainbow trout with some sculpin.  Downstream species assemblage was more diverse including rainbow trout, sculpin,
burbot and suckers `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-04)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d02)."))` Length and weight was collected for all fish captured.  Rainbow trout and burbot measured with a fork length greater than 60mm were also tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-05) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-125261-d03)."))` Data collected can be accessed [here](`r paste0(params$repo_url, "blob/main/data/habitat_confirmations.xls")`).

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}
Replacement of PSCIS crossing `r my_site` on Fern Creek is a priority for this overall project as this is a large system likely
containing no other anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage. The presence of burbot in the system is of particular
interest as this fish provides good food values and in general, compared to numerous other species (ex. steelhead and
coho), burbot are documented as less capable swimmers considering time-to-fatigue versus swim speed
[@katopodis_gervais2016Fishswimming]. The presence of burbot downstream of the crossing and absence in sample sites
above could indicate that the crossing is preventing some migration of this species however sample areas were small and
the habitat presence/preference may have been more a determinant of presence than the passability of the crossing.

<br>

Recapture of fish PIT tagged during 2023 fieldwork will build our understanding of fish movement and health at the site
with information collected useful for monitoring the effectiveness of crossing replacement. Additionally, aerial imagery
and 3D models can be used to monitor changes in stream morphology and effectiveness of environmental management plans as
well as site rehabilitation efforts following construction. The work is tentatively scheduled for 2025 with engineering 
design led by Canfor.
