"],["executive-summary.html", "Executive Summary", " Executive Summary The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off-channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat, and summer rearing habitat. Upgrading or removing road crossing structures presents numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by incorporating fish passage considerations into repair, replacement, relocation, and deactivation designs. The Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) is collaborating with the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders, and other FWCP stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan, and fund the restoration of fish passage at road crossing structure barriers within the Parsnip River, Carp River, and Crooked River watershed groups. The project engages FWCP partners and stakeholders to clearly communicate fish passage issues in FWCP Peace Region watersheds while collaboratively planning and executing the steps necessary to achieve fish passage restorations. The work completed and ongoing aligns with the Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program Rivers, Lakes and Reservoirs Action Plan (Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program 2020) sub-objective 6 of addressing fish passage issues in streams to enhance the productivity of priority species. Project activities undertaken address the following actions: PEA.RLR.S06.RI.20 - Conducting engagement to prioritize options for fish passage improvement-P1 PEA.RLR.S06.RI.19 - Conducting research to prioritize fish passage actions-P1 PEA.RLR.S06.HB.21 - Restoring fish access to streams-P1 This project builds on the work of the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) in 2019 - 2020 (A. Irvine 2020), 2021 - 2022(A. Irvine 2022), and 2022 - 2023 (Allan Irvine and Winterscheidt 2023). Through 2023/2024 project activities, numerous project partners were engaged, and we identified and conducted fish passage planning/restoration activities at multiple priority sites: In addition to numerous small-scale presentations and meetings, we conducted an online presentation through FWCP to showcase the project on February 23, 2024, with over 70 people in attendance. A presentation to the FWCP board of directors detailing project progress, goals, and budgets was also completed on February 6, 2024. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities, a collaborative GIS environment has been established as a space where project team members and collaborators can access, view, and contribute to spatial datasets and the development of restoration/monitoring plans for the project. BCTS used our project documentation to justify investments in road deactivation, leading to the restoration of fish passage at numerous crossings in the Parsnip River watershed, including two priority sites documented in the FWCP-funded (A. Irvine 2020). In 2024, Canfor plans to replace crossing 125231 (Tributary to Table River) at km21 on the Chuchinka-Table FSR with a bridge. An engineering design is complete, materials are sourced, and a contract with Canfor is in place for installation preparations (engineering design, environmental management planning/permitting, and material acquisition). The estimated replacement cost is $410,000, with Canfor committing $205,000. To proceed in 2024, FWCP support is necessary to cover the remaining 50% ($90,000) of project costs. Fish sampling with PIT tagging of target species and the acquisition of aerial imagery took place in 2023 as part of baseline monitoring for the site. Fish sampling with PIT tagging of target species and the acquisition of aerial imagery took place at Fern Creek located at km2.1 of the Chuchinka-Table FSR as part of baseline monitoring for the site, tentatively scheduled to be replaced in 2025. McLeod Lake’s capacity to engage in fisheries management and restoration activities within their territory is building through training, fieldwork, and inclusion in planning and communication processes. To diversify potential partners for implementation and funding, planning and field assessments were conducted at 80 sites in the Carp River, Crooked River, and Parsnip River watershed groups. This included initial surveys on numerous Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure sites, incorporating recently adapted assessments that include climate change risk assessment metrics. Recommendations going forward include: Continue to engage partners to raise funds for remediations, identify sites for restoration, conduct remedial works, and assess the effectiveness of works. Continue to conduct detailed assessments where blockages are present and large amounts of habitat are potentially available within the Parsnip River and neighboring watershed groups. As timelines for remediations can be extensive, planning onerous, and the costs of remedial works significant, continuing assessments throughout the greater area will provide more options for remediation and engage additional funding partners (e.g., Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, alternative forest licensees). Identifying areas of concern near the community of McLeod Lake is expected to further engage community members and most effectively promote restoration activities. Conduct effectiveness monitoring where sites have been remediated, prioritized, and where remediations are planned. Electrofishing surveys, including tagging of target species with PIT tags, are recommended to understand the extent of connectivity impairments, track fish movement/health over time, and inform adaptive management. Detailed habitat assessments and acquisition of temperature data can be considered along with photo documentation of stream morphology near crossings. "],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. The Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) is working together with the McLeod Lake Indian Band, the Peace Region Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (FWCP), the Provincial Fish Passage Technical Working Group (FPTWG), road/rail tenure holders and other stakeholders/partners to prioritize, plan and fund the restoration of fish passage at road crossing structure barriers within the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups. This project builds on Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (SERNbc) work in 2019 - 2020 (A. Irvine 2020), 2021 - 2022(A. Irvine 2022) and 2022 - 2023 (Allan Irvine and Winterscheidt 2023). Through this year’s project activities (2023/2024) we engaged numerous project partners and were able to identify, complete and catalyze fish passage restoration activities at multiple priority sites. Through the ongoing development of open source analysis, data presentation and project collaboration tools we are identifying new restoration opportunities, clarifying restoration benefits, communicating with the broader community and implementing on the ground works.

In 2023 filed assessments were completed with the Parsnip River, Carp River and Crooked River watershed groups (Figure 2.1). In 2019/2020, following a literature review, analysis of fish habitat modelling data, the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) and a community scoping exercise within the McLeod Lake Indian Band habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 17 sites throughout the Parsnip River watershed with 10 crossings rated as high priorities for rehabilitation and three crossings rated as moderate priorities for restoration. An engineering design for site 125179 on a tributary to the Missinka River was also completed through the 2019/2020 project. In 2021/2022, project activities reconvened through FWCP directed project PEA-F22-F-3577-DCA. Partners were engaged, funding was raised, planning was conducted and reporting was completed to initiate restoration activities of high priority crossings. Materials were purchased and permitting was put in place to prep for replacement of the twin culverts on the Missinka River tributary with a clear-span bridge. In 2022/2023, this collaborative project leveraged ongoing connectivity restoration initiatives in the province and engaged multiple partners to catalyze fish passage restoration activities at high-priority sites identified in 2019/2020 and 2021/2022. Key accomplishments include the replacement of PSCIS crossing 125179, prioritization of two crossings on the Chuchinka-Table FSR for replacement in 2024-2025 (with engineering designs commissioned and materials purchased), and field assessments including fish sampling at high priority crossing 125000 on a tributary to the Parsnip River near Arctic Lake. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/peace_fish_passage_2023.jpeg&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Area 2.1 Tse’khene The Parsnip River watershed is located within the south-eastern portion of the 108,000 km2 traditional territory of the Tse’khene from the McLeod Lake Indian Band. The Tse’khene “People of the Rocks” are a south westerly extension of the Athabascan speaking people of northern Canada. They were nomadic hunters whose language belongs to the Beaver-Sarcee-Tse’khene branch of Athapaskan (“History Who We Are” 2023). Extensive work is underway to preserve the language with resources such as First Voices available online and in app form for iphone and ipad devices. The continental divide separates watersheds flowing north into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and south and west into the Pacific Ocean via the Fraser River (Figure 2.1). The Parsnip River is a 6th order stream with a watershed that drains an area of 5597km2. The mainstem of the river flows within the Rocky Mountain Trench in a north direction into Williston Reservoir starting from the continental divide adjacent to Arctic Lakes. Major tributaries include the Misinchinka, Colbourne, Reynolds, Anzac, Table, Hominka and Missinka sub-basins which drain the western slopes of the Hart Ranges of the Rocky Mountains. The Parsnip River has a mean annual discharge of 150.4 m3/s with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). Construction of the 183 m high and 2134 m long W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1967 at Hudson’s Hope, BC, creating the Williston Reservoir (Hirst 1991). Filling of the 375km2 reservoir was complete in 1972 and flooded a substantial portion of the Parsnip River and major tributary valleys forming what is now known as the Peace and Parsnip reaches. The replacement of riverine habitat with an inundated reservoir environment resulted in profound changes to the ecology, resource use and human settlement patterns in these systems (Hagen et al. 2015a; Pearce et al. 2019; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017). Prior to the filling of the reservoir, the Pack River, into which McLeod Lake flows, was a major tributary to the Parsnip River. The Pack River currently enters the Williston Reservoir directly as the historic location of the confluence of the two rivers lies within the reservoir’s footprint. # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology1-1.png&quot;) ##left this here in case we want to go back to having this build from scratch. # img &lt;- png::readPNG(&quot;fig/hydrology1.png&quot;) # grid::grid.raster(img) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_07EE007.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Parsnip River Above Misinchinka River (Station #07EE007 - Lat 55.08194 Lon -122.913063).

In addition to flooding related to the formation of the Williston Reservoir, transmission lines, gas pipelines, rail, road networks, forestry, elevated water temperatures, interrupted connectivity, invasion from non-native species and insect infestations affecting forested areas pose threats to fisheries values in the Parsnip River watershed (Hagen et al. 2015b; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017; Hagen and Weber 2019a; Comittee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada 2012). A brief summary of trends and knowledge status related to Arctic grayling, bull trout, kokanee, mountain whitefish and rainbow trout in Williston Watershed streams is provided in Fish and Wildlife Compensation Program (2020) with a more detailed review of the state of knowledge for Parsnip River watershed populations of Arctic grayling and bull trout provided below. fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) fiss_species_table %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River, Carp Lake, and Crooked River watershed groups.&#39;, footnote_text = &#39;COSEWIC abbreviations : SC - Special concern DD - Data deficient NAR - Not at risk BC List definitions : Yellow - Species that is apparently secure Blue - Species that is of special concern Exotic - Species that have been moved beyond their natural range as a result of human activity &#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River, Carp Lake, and Crooked River watershed groups.

Bull Trout populations of the Williston Reservoir watershed are included within the Western Arctic population ‘Designatable Unit 10’, which, in 2012, received a ranking of ‘Special Concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC 2012a). They were added to Schedule 1 under the Species of Risk Act in 2019 (Species Registry Canada 2020) and are also considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020). Some or all of the long-term foot survey index sections of four Williston Reservoir spawning tributaries (Davis Creek, Misinchinka River, Point Creek, and Scott Creek), have been surveyed within 16 of the 19 years between 2001 and 2019 (16 of 19 in Davis River, 10 years over a 13-year period in the Misinchinka River, 11 years over a 14-year period for Point Creek, and 9 years over an 11-year period for Scott Creek (Hagen, Spendlow, and Pillipow 2020). A study of sa’ba critical habitats in the Parsnip River was conducted in 2014 with the Misinchinka and Anzac systems identified as the most important systems for adfluvial (large bodied) bull trout spawners. The Table River was also highlighted as an important spawning destination. Other watersheds identified as containing runs of large bodied bull troutspawners included the Colbourne, Reynolds, Hominka and Missinka River with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing each sub-basin (Hagen et al. 2015a). Hagen and Weber (2019b) have synthesized a large body of information regarding limiting factors, enhancement potential, critical habitats and conservation status for bull trout of the Williston Reservoir and the reader is encouraged to review this work for context. They have recommended experimental enhancements within a monitoring framework for Williston Reservoir bull trout (some spawning and rearing in Parsnip River mainstem and tributaries) which include stream fertilization, side channel development, riparian restoration and fish access improvement. In 2018, sub-basins of the Anzac River watershed, Homininka River, Missinka River and Table River watersheds were designated as fisheries sensitive watersheds under the authority of the Forest and Range Practices Act due to significant downstream fisheries values and significant watershed sensitivity (P. G. Beaudry 2013a, 2014a, 2014b, 2013b). Special management is required in these watersheds to protect habitat for fish species including bull trout and Arctic grayling including measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement (Forest and Range Practices Act 2018). Arctic Grayling - dusk’ihje Tse’khene Elders from the McLeod Lake Indian Band report that Arctic grayling numbers have declined dramatically since the flooding of the reservoir and that few dusk’ihje (Arctic Grayling) have been caught in the territory in the past 30 years (Pearce et al. 2019). Since impoundment of the Williston Reservoir, it appears that physical habitat and ecological changes have been the most significant factors limiting Arctic grayling productivity. Although these changes are not well understood they have likely resulted in the inundation of key low gradient juvenile rearing and overwintering habitats, isolation of previously connected populations and increases in abundance of predators such as bull trout (Shrimpton, Roberts, and Clarke 2012; Hagen, Pillipow, and Gantner 2018). Rapid increases in industrial activity and angler access in the Parsnip River watershed pose significant risks to Arctic Grayling productivity with these threats primarily linked to forestry and pipeline initiatives (Hagen and Stamford 2021). A detailed review of dusk’ihje life history can be referenced in Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson (2017). Migration of mature adult dusk’ihje (Arctic grayling) occurs in the spring with arrival at known spawning locations coinciding with water temperatures of 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. Spawning in the Parsnip watershed appears to occur between late-May and late-June within sites located primarily within the lower reaches of the Anzac and Table rivers as well as within the Parsnip River mainstem. Side-channel and multiple-channel locations containing small gravels appear to be selected for spawning. Currently, the primary distribution of Williston Arctic grayling appears to be among fourth order and larger streams (Williamson and Zimmerman 2005; Stamford, Hagen, and Williamson 2017). Stewart et al. (2007) report that Arctic grayling spawn in large and small tributaries to rivers and lakes, intermittent streams, within mainstem rivers as well as lakes, most commonly at tributary mouths. Although past study results indicate that 0+ grayling appeared to overwinter in lower reaches of larger tributaries (i.e. Table, Anzac rivers) as well as the Parsnip River and that few age-1+ grayling have been sampled in tributaries, habitat use in small tributaries and the extent they are connected with the mainstem habitats of all core areas is not well understood. Between 1995 and 2019, Arctic grayling population monitoring has been conducted in the Table River in nine out of 25 years (8 years for the Anzac) using snorkel surveys. Results from 2018 are 2019 are intended to contribute to the assessment of the conservation status of the species in the Parsnip Core area (Hagen, Pillipow, and Gantner 2018). In 2019, preliminary telemetry results indicate that both Arctic grayling and bull trout rely on the Parsnip River mainstem for overwinter residencies. Arctic grayling move into the tributaries beginning in April, and become widespread across the watershed by June. Year 3 of a 5 year study on Parsnip River watershed abundance and trend are discussed in Hagen and Stamford (2021) where they report that the most productive habitats for Arctic grayling summer rearing are within the Missinka, Hominka, Anzac and Table Rivers. Although estimated abundance is lower than in the Anzac and Table Rivers, productive summer rearing habitats for adult Arctic grayling in the upper Parsnip River watershed are distributed between 36-29 km of the Missinka River and from 48-32 km of the Hominka River. In the Anzac River, a 30-km stretch from a chute obstruction at 47 km to 16 km is assumed to provide productive summer rearing habitats for adult as it is characterized by a high abundance of Arctic grayling. Although the spatial distribution of high Arctic grayling abundance in the Table River has not been determined through reconnaissance surveys it has been observed to span at least a 20-km zone from the waterfall migration barrier at 37 km to 18 km. Spatial ecology studies in the Parsnip between 2018 and 2021 has been reported on by Martins et al. (2022) with results related to: temperature modeling and spatio-temporal patterns in thermal habitat, telemetry data modeling and arctic grayling spatial ecology, and trophic relationships between Arctic grayling and bull trout A review of available fisheries data for the Parsnip River watershed stratified by different habitat characteristics can provide insight into which habitats may provide the highest intrinsic value for fish species based on the number of fish captured in those habitats in past assessment work (Figures 2.4 - 2.6). It should be noted however that it should not be assumed that all habitat types have been sampled in a non-biased fashion or that particular sites selected do not have a disproportionate influence on the overall dataset composition (ie. fish salvage sites are often located adjacent to construction sites which are more commonly located near lower gradient stream reaches). # fiss_sum &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/extracted_inputs/fiss_sum.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_grad &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_grad.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_width &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_width.csv&#39;)) fiss_sum_wshed &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/fiss_sum_wshed.csv&#39;)) # A summary of historical westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group by average gradient category of associated stream segment is provided in Figure \\@ref(fig:fish-wct-bar).

Engagement actions have included video conference calls, meetings, emails, presentations and phone calls. 3.1.2 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities a collaborative GIS environment has been established using QGIS served on the cloud using source code kept stored here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access and view and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about how GIS project creation and update scripts function can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: - download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalougue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. - A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). - Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. 3.1.3 Issue Tracking “Issues” logged on the online github platform are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs related to project components. They can be referenced with the scripts, text and actions used to address them by linking documentation to the issues with text comments or programatically through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here. 3.1.4 Mapping Maps incorporating the sa’ba (bull trout) spawning and rearing habitat model for the Parsnip River, Carp Lake and Crooked River watershed groups are served online and were were generated using reproducible open source workflows developed by Hillcrest Geographics. The workflows to produce the georeferenced pdf maps include using a QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required and are continuously evolving. At the time of reporting - mapping scripts and associated layer file were kept under version control within bcfishpass (https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/qgis). Use of the QGIS layer file allows load and representation all map component layers provided the user points to the postgresql database loaded and built with bcfishpass. ### Interactive Dashboard # We built an interactive dashboard to allow users to conduct background research and planning to facilitate communication and enable future field surveys in the Peace Region. The interactive interface allows screening of previously inventoried as well as modelled stream crossing locations based on watershed group as well as the likely quantity and quality of bull trout rearing and spawning habitat modelled upstream. Historic assessment data including photos of sites can be viewed when present and through the dashboard users can download csv results and associated georeferenced field maps to facilitate field surveys. The dashboard was built using `R` packages `crosstalk` [@cheng_sievert2022Crosstalk], `DT` [@xie_etal2022interfaceDataTables] and `Leaflet` [@cheng_etal2022InterfaceLeaflet]. 3.1.4.1 Habitat Modelling Through this initiative, other SERNbc led initiatives (Irvine 2021, [2021] 2022), multi-decade direction from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning conducted by Canadian Wildlife Federation and others (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021; Irvine 2022), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris ([2020] 2021) using sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris [2020] 2021). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with numerous parameters including known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, and an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams). Furthermore, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area, stream discharge and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. Regarding gradients, bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this phase of the project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that rainbow trout (20%) and bull trout (25%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 20% and 25% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2019b) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, or multiple FISS channel widths are available a mean of the average channel widths was used. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were downloaded to a postgresql database, sampled for upstream watershed areas associated with each stream segment and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. In early 2021, Bayesian statistical methods were developed to predict channel width in all provincial freshwater atlas stream segments where width measurements had not previously been measured in the field. The model was based on the relationship between watershed area and mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area (Thorley and Irvine 2021). In December of 2021, Thorley and Irvine (2021) methods were updated using on a power model derived by Finnegan et al. (2005) which relates stream discharge to watershed area and mean annual precipitation. Data (n = 24849) on watershed size, mean annual precipitation and measured channel width was extracted from the provincial freshwater atlas (FLNRORD 2021; GeoBC 2022), the BC Data Catalouge fisheries datasets (MoE 2020b, 2021) and Wang et al. (2012) utilizing bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2021) and fwapg (Norris [2019] 2021). Details of this analysis and subsequent outputs can be reviewed here (Thorley, Norris, and Irvine 2021). bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2019b). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Parsnip River watershed group have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest potential intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Definitions of modelling outputs for bull trout are presented in Table 3.2. Modelling of habitat for Arctic grayling, in the Peace region are planned for 2024-2025 with the work leveraging multiple other initiatives underway by SERNbc and others throughout British Columbia including work related to Arctic grayling habitat use and preference conducted by UNBC and others [Hagen and Stamford (2023); Bottoms et al.

The reader is referred to (BC Ministry of Environment 2011) for detailed methodology. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.3). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see [Barrier Scoring]), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. fpr_table_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.3: Table 3.4: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per BC Ministry of Environment (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.5, Table 3.6. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier Habitat gain indexes are the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 25% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (bull trout) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. This is the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 25% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020a) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, bull trout rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate estimates for area of habitat upstream (m^2), the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. 3.2.1 Cost Estimates Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates which have since been adjusted for inflation and based on past experience. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $25000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $50k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page then adjusted for inflation). For larger streams (&gt;6m), estimated span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream. For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.7) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% filter(Class != &#39;FSR&#39; &amp; Surface != &#39;Paved&#39;) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.7: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Completed designs are loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.4 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.3). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 500 - 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit PG23-813101. 3.5 Remediations Structure replacement was conducted by contractors hired by Sinclar (forest licensee). As-built drawings were completed and loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.6 Climate Change Risk Assessment In collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTi), a new climate change replacement program aims to prioritize vulnerable culverts for replacement (pers. comm Sean Wong, 2022) based on data collected and ranked related to three categories - culvert condition, vulnerability and priority. Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.8).

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.1.1.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_imagery_and_base_maps.mot_culverts_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/89d44ba6-7236-48ed-afab-f25a98c846ef A Culvert is a pipe (less than 3m in diameter) or half-round flume used to transport or drain water under or away from the road and/or right of way.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number. The AFFECTED_ADMIN_AREA_ABRVN identifies the administrative areas that are affected by the OIC.

A total of 70 Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included 20 crossings considered “passable”, 6 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 40 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (BC Ministry of Environment 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 4 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.2. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed BC Ministry of Environment (2011) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments conducted on sites not yet inventoried in PSCIS.

A total of approximately 3km of stream was assessed. Georeferenced field maps are presented in Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, 0 crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 4 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 1 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.3 - 4.4 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format here. A summary of preliminary modelling results illustrating quantities of bull trout spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing as estimated by measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length are presented in Figure 4.2.

An engineering design was completed in 2023 with some of the materials purchased for the replacement funded through this project. More detail on the site is presented in the appendix of this report titled “Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix”. 4.5 Remediations In 2023, BCTS was able to use our project documentation to provide justification for investments in road deactivation leading to the restoration of fish passage at numerous crossings in the Parsnip River watershed including two sites ranked as priorities as part of habitat confirmation assessments documented in the FWCP funded A. Irvine (2020). Crossing 125345, located on a tributary to the Parsnip River, was removed (along with four other culverts) during deactivation of approximately 9km of the Chuchinka-Colbourne FSR from Reynolds Creek south to approximately 9km north of the Anzac River. The site had been prioritized in A. Irvine (2020) with that report available here. Crossing 125403, located on a tributary to the Parsnip River, was removed (along with dozens of other culverts) during deactivation of approximately 17km of the Hodda FSR. The site had been prioritized in A. Irvine (2020) with that report available here. 4.6 Monitoring Fish sampling was conducted at a tributary to Table River (PSCIS 125231) Fern Creek (PSCIS 125261) to serve as baseline monitoring before structure replacements. Sampling was planned at a tributary to Missinka River (PSCIS 125179) however the site was inacessible due to a forest fire in the area. Electrofishing was conducted at 12 sites with a total of 171 fish captured. Fork length data was used to delineate rainbow trout based on life stages: fry (0 to 65mm), parr (&gt;65 to 110mm), juvenile (&gt;110mm to 140mm) and adult (&gt;140mm) by visually assessing the histograms presented in Figure 4.3. A summary of sites assessed are included in Table 4.8 and raw data is provided in Attachment 3. A summary of density results for all life stages combined of select species is also presented in Figure 4.4. Detailed results for tributary to Table River (PSCIS 125231) are presented in the appendix to this report titled “Tributary to the Table River - 125231 - Appendix”. Results for Fern Creek (PSCIS 125261) are presented in “Fern Creek - 125261 - Appendix”. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fish_histogram.png&quot;) Figure 4.3: Histograms of fish lengths by species.

The projected costs for replacing culverts with bridges on small streams, on unpaved resource roads, have surged from around $180,000 in 2020 to over $400,000 in 2023. These estimates are just a fraction of the costs associated with structure replacements on railways, highways, and paved roads, which can range from near a million to tens of millions of dollars per crossing. This challenge poses a significant obstacle without straightforward mitigation. We are actively seeking new funding partners and are requesting current funders consider increasing financial support for necessary actions. Infrastructure replacements and removals, even with full funding secured, are complex, taking several years to plan and implement, often involving multiple partners with divergent perspectives. Cost estimates stay uncertain even post-design, and numerous factors can cause delays or derail plans completely. When financial support depends on annual renewals with expectations for swift outcomes, planning becomes exceptionally challenging. Some landowners and tenure holders lack support to implement remedial actions on the infrastructure they manage, hindering progress in fish passage restoration efforts. CN Rail infrastructure, in particular, significantly contributes to fish passage issues in the FWCP Peace Region. However, representatives from the company have communicated that historically they have been supported to complete one small fish passage remediation project per year across all of western Canada. We are exploring strategies to encourage collaborative cooperation and investment from these stakeholders. Economic uncertainty in the forestry sector, resulting from deferred cutting permits on land tracks designated as “old-growth management areas,” has significantly impacted our study area. The British Columbia government has urged licensees to postpone harvesting in these areas until a “new approach for old growth forest management” is developed and many cutting permits have been on extended hold. Despite initial plans for the remediation of site 125000 near Arctic Lake in the summer of 2023, our project partner and forest licensee in the area, Sinclar Group, communicated in the spring of 2023 that road updates were no longer practical due to the deferrals affecting logging plans beyond the culvert. Consequently, they would not be able to allocate FWCP dollars earmarked for the site from the 2021/2022 or 2022/2023 fiscal funding pots towards the project. Fortunately, we were able to reallocate their funding to Canfor to catalyze restoration on the Missinka-Table FSR watershed instead. 4.8.2 Project Complexity and Communication It is challenging to communicate the complexity of fish passage issues to diverse partners/stakeholders. Connectivity is on a spectrum and is not often 100% or 0% with costs of remediation high. Often there are multiple crossings on the same stream with different landowners and tenure holders for each. We will continue to build relationships and tools to help understand and communicate the issues and find ways forward that involve meaningful actions. Collecting and presenting fish passage data poses challenges for field teams due to the large size of study areas, arduous field conditions and the complexity of stream crossing and habitat data. To address this, we are developing open-source collaborative GIS projects, mobile data collection, and iterative reporting systems to facilitate collaboration and share knowledge and methodologies with diverse partners. 4.8.3 Complimentary Programs 4.8.3.1 Arctic Grayling Research Ongoing work in the Parsnip Core area regarding Arctic grayling abundance estimates, critical habitat and spatial ecology is providing valuable information to inform fish passage restoration efforts. Consultants and researchers have been developing multiple programs in the area with the support of the FWCP Peace Region. We are working together with these teams to incorporate their findings into our fish passage restoration planning. 4.8.3.2 BCHydro Fish Passage Program The BC Hydro Fish Passage Program is currently working with First Nations, regulators and stakeholders in the region to develop strategies to offset impacts of fish entertainment related to the Site C dam expansion project. We met with West Moberly-DWB Limited Partnership to discuss how our prgrams can collaborate to identify potential sites for remediation. 4.8.3.3 Climate Change Climate change is a significant threat to fish and fish habitat. We are working with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to incorporate climate change risk assessments into our fish passage restoration planning and plan to continue the evolution of this program into the future. Additionally, we will utilize climate modelling data to support prioritization of crossings (e.g., to support access to cold, drought resistant areas). Progress on this work is underway with details of some of the work here, here and here. "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations To effectively enhance fish passage restoration efforts in the FWCP Peace Region, we recommend the following actions: Continue to engage partners to raise funds, identify sites, conduct remedial works, and assess effectiveness. This approach ensures efficient fish passage restoration incorporating adaptive management informed by traditional knowledge and real-time planning/monitoring data. Conduct detailed assessments in areas with blockages and significant habitat potential. Ongoing assessments throughout the greater area will provide more remediation options and attract additional funding partners, particularly near the community of McLeod Lake. Collaborate with UNBC and expert consultants to integrate Arctic grayling research into fish passage restoration planning. Prioritize obtaining financial commitments for the restoration of Fern Creek on the Chuchinka-Table FSR, despite uncertainties in Canfor’s harvest plans. Conduct effectiveness monitoring at remediated sites, prioritized sites, and planned remediation locations. Utilize electrofishing surveys, PIT tagging, habitat assessments, temperature data collection, and photo documentation. Follow up monitoring at site 125179 in the Missinka River watershed, including electrofishing and photo documentation. Use nearby site 125180 as a reference for comparison. Reassess site 125000 on the Chuchinka-Arctic FSR in 2024, focusing on the impact of the perched culvert on fish movement and health. Monitor PSCIS crossing 125231 on a tributary to the Table River after Canfor completes remediation in 2024, using fish sampling and aerial imagery to demonstrate the positive impact of project investments.

The culverts are located 0.7km from the confluence of the Table River and approximately 200m upstream of a CN Railway culvert (PSCIS 197493 - discussed below). Canfor Corporation are the primary forest licensee at this location with the Ministry of Forests as the road tenure holders. The site was originally prioritized for replacement in A. Irvine (2020), following a habitat confirmation assessment which can be found here. Background The subject stream flows in a southern direction into the Table River at a point 7.9 km upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River. At crossing 125231, the tributary to the Table River is a third order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 4km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1605m to 754m at the crossing (Table 5.1). PSCIS crossing 197493 is located on the CN Railway approximately 200m downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR where replacement of PSCIS crossing 125231 is planned. At the time of assessments conducted in both 2019 and 2022, the fully embedded culvert was considered passable according to provincial metrics (MoE 2011). A recently installed bridge (PSCIS 197499) is located approximately 450m upstream of the crossing and there are no other anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage upstream. Upstream of crossing 125231, rainbow trout have previously been recorded (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.2. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093J.120. At the time of writing, Canfor was planning to replace crossing 125231 with a bridge. An engineering design had been completed, some of the materials have been purchased (bridge structure and abutments) and contractors were selected through a tendering process led by Canfor to complete the work. Environmental management plans had been drafted for the project and permitting was underway. The cost of replacement was estimated at $410,000. Canfor had committed to paying half with FWCP pledging the remainder. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.1: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 125231.

Fish Sampling A total six sites were sampled in the vicinity of crossing 125231 with three sites located upstream and three sites located downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables 5.3 - 5.4 and Figure 5.3. A total of 59 rainbow trout were captured upstream, and 27 rainbow trout were captured downstream (Figures 5.4 - 5.7). All fish captured with a fork length greater than 60mm were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) with data stored here. 5.2 Conclusion As PSCIS crossing 197493 located on the CN Railway approximately 200m downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR where replacement of PSCIS crossing 125231 is planned, is a fully embedded culvert considered pasable at the time of assessments in 2019 and again in 2022, restoration of fish passage at the FSR provides a relatively rare opportunity in the Table River watershed toremediate fish passage on a forest service road where passage is not also impeded by a CN Railway structure. Although the stream is smaller in size, it is located within an area designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed with habitat presence suitable for bull trout (Western Arctic population) which has been assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern (P. Beaudry 2014; COSEWIC 2012b). Restoration of fish passage at crossing 125231 is lined up for the summer of 2024 with a design specifications to replace the two 1.2m round pipes (outlet drops of 0.65m) with a 12.2m steel girder/timber deck bridge on spread footing. Replacement of the crossing will provide access to habitat blocked to upstream migrating fish for likely 10 - 20 years (timeline depending on the rate of down cutting caused by the outlet drops) and the stream has no other anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage. The presence of burbot in the system is of particular interest as this fish provides good food values and in general, compared to numerous other species (ex. steelhead and coho), burbot are documented as less capable swimmers considering time-to-fatigue versus swim speed (Katopodis and Gervais 2016). The presence of burbot downstream of the crossing and absence in sample sites above could indicate that the crossing is preventing some migration of this species however sample areas were small and the habitat presence/preference may have been more a determinant of presence than the passability of the crossing. Resampling of fish at the site in future years of the project is recommended to build our understanding of fish use, movement and health in the stream providing valueable data for monitoring the effectiveness of crossing replacement. Additionally, aquisition of aerial imagery following structure replacement is recommended so that aerial imagery and 3D models generated from the data can be compared to products generated from data gathered in 2023. These comparisons will be useful for communications related to the project as well as for providing insight into changes in stream morphology, effectiveness of environmental management plans and site rehabilitation efforts following construction. fpr_table_fish_site() Table 5.3: Fish sampling site summary for 125231. site passes ef_length_m ef_width_m area_m2 enclosure 125231_ds_ef1 1 10 1.6 16.0 open 125231_ds_ef2 1 12 2.6 31.2 open 125231_ds_ef3 1 17 2.2 37.4 open 125231_us_ef1 1 15 1.9 28.5 open 125231_us_ef2 1 19 1.9 36.1 open 125231_us_ef3 1 29 1.7 49.3 open fpr_table_fish_density() Table 5.4: Fish sampling density results summary for 125231. local_name species_code life_stage catch density_100m2 nfc_pass 125231_ds_ef1 RB fry 8 50.0 FALSE 125231_ds_ef1 RB parr 2 12.5 FALSE 125231_ds_ef2 RB fry 10 32.1 FALSE 125231_ds_ef2 RB parr 1 3.2 FALSE 125231_ds_ef3 RB fry 5 13.4 FALSE 125231_ds_ef3 RB parr 1 2.7 FALSE 125231_us_ef1 RB fry 14 49.1 FALSE 125231_us_ef2 RB fry 10 27.7 FALSE 125231_us_ef2 RB adult 1 2.8 FALSE 125231_us_ef3 RB fry 34 69.0 FALSE * nfc_pass FALSE means fish were captured in final pass indicating more fish of this species/lifestage may have remained in site.

Canfor Corporation are the primary forest licensee at this location with the Ministry of Forests as the road tenure holders.The site was originally prioritized for replacement through this project in 2022 - 2023, following a habitat confirmation assessment which can be found here (A. Irvine and Wintersheidt 2023). Background At crossing 125261, is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 23.5km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1137m to 730m near the crossing (Table 5.5). Fish species confirmed upstream of the FSR include burbot, rainbow trout, bull trout, sucker, reside shiner, dace and chub (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). A total of 148ha of lake and 37ha of wetland are modelled upstream. This includes Fern Lakes, a collection of three lakes that have a combined area of approximately 138ha. The outlet of the first lake in the chain is 3.3km upstream of the FSR. It appears that there have been fish passage retoration efforts at this corossing in the past as metal bafles have been installed within the structure. As the pipe is undersized for the crossing, it has downcut an outlet drop and flow velocities within the structure are too high for the baffles to retain substrate and function effectively. Although larger fish are likely able to ascend through the crossing (depending on size of the fish, swimming ability and flow levels at the time of upstream migration) the crossing isi still considered a barrier to fish passage and likely blocks migration of all juvenile life stages at all time of year. Crossing characteristics are described in detail here. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table 5.6. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093J.119. At the time of writing, Canfor was going through the planning process to replace crossing 125261 with a bridge with drafts of an engineering design completed from funding provided internally from Canfor. The cost of replacement was estimated at $430,000 however this figure can be considered preliminary and subject to change. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 5.5: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 125261.

Fish Sampling A total six sites were sampled in the vicinity of crossing 125261 with three sites located upstream and three sites located downstream of the Chuckinka-Table FSR. Electrofishing results are summarised in Tables 5.7 - 5.8 and Figure 5.10. A total of 48 fish were captured upstream, and 37 fish were captured downstream. Fish species upstream included primarily rainbow trout with some sculpin. Downstream species assemblage was more diverse including rainbow trout, sculpin, burbot and suckers (Figures 5.11 - 5.14). Length and weight was collected for all fish captured. Rainbow trout and burbot measured with a fork length greater than 60mm were also tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) (Figures 5.15 - 5.16). Data collected can be accessed here. 5.4 Conclusion Replacement of PSCIS crossing 125261 on Fern Creek is a priority for this overall project as this is a large system likely containing no other anthropogenic obstructions to fish passage. The presence of burbot in the system is of particular interest as this fish provides good food values and in general, compared to numerous other species (ex. steelhead and coho), burbot are documented as less capable swimmers considering time-to-fatigue versus swim speed (Katopodis and Gervais 2016). The presence of burbot downstream of the crossing and absence in sample sites above could indicate that the crossing is preventing some migration of this species however sample areas were small and the habitat presence/preference may have been more a determinant of presence than the passability of the crossing. Recapture of fish PIT tagged during 2023 fieldwork will build our understanding of fish movement and health at the site with information collected useful for monitoring the effectiveness of crossing replacement.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198714, located within the campground was un-embedded, non-backwatered and had a culvert slope estimated at 5%. Although the crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the MoE (2011) provincial protocol, juvenile (&gt;100mm) and adult salmonids are likely able to migrate through the short pipe length (5m) with no outlet drop (Table 5.11). A deep outlet pool (1m) and a large outlet drop (0.7m) at the Highway 97 crossing (PSCIS 198666) was an indication that the culvert is undersized for the amount of discharge in the watershed. The large outlet drop (0.7m) and extensive length (60m) of the structure likely block upstream migration for all fish life stages and species at all flows. The unembedded and non-backwaered culvert ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to MoE (2011) (Table 5.12). Water temperature was 12.7\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 410uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.11: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198714.

In the area surveyed, the stream was noted as having good flow and abundant gravels suitable for rainbow trout spawning. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.8m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 2.7%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks. The habitat was rated as medium value with habitat present suitable for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198666 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198666 for 220m beginning at a point accessed approximately 275m upstream of the highway (Figures 5.19 - 5.22). The dominant substrate was fines with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.4m, the average wetted width was 2.5m, and the average gradient was 1.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation. It was noted that there were no gravels observed in the area surveyed within the shallow fine substrate channels connecting numerous beaver dams within a wetland type area. The habitat was rated as medium value with some very deep pool areas upstream of beaver dams. The stream was also assessed at the location of crossing 198710 located approximately 1..7km upsteam of the highway. Crossing 198710 was found to be a washed out bridge. To help build an understanding of fish habitat values upstream of the highway crossing the stream was also surveyed at this location for a distance of 200m within a large beaver influenced wetland area containing turbid water. Numerous beaver dams were observed. No gravels were noted (Figures 5.19 - 5.22). The average channel width was 3.6m, the average wetted width was 3.3m, and the average gradient was 1.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. The habitat was rated as value containing habitat suitable for rearing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate It is recommended that if 198714 is not essential for vehicle traffic that the small structure be replaced with a walking bridge or removed completely. If either of those options are not suitable, replacement of the crossing with a bridge (10m span) is estimated to cost $NA. The culvert under the highway would require extensive works to complete costing an estimated $1,500,000 Conclusion Although the culvert at PSCIS crossing 198714 was not considered a severe barrier to upstream fish passage due to its short length and lack of outlet drop, the structure is likely undersized for the amount of discharge in the watershed. The straight and uniform channel in the areas adjacent to the lake indicate that historically the stream channel may have been dredged to confine the stream to a define channel to facilitate culvert installation and reduce maintenance. The location of this crossing within the campground and immediately adjacent to the community of McLeod Lake may present opportunities for not only the removal or replacement of the current structure but also potentially restoration of the stream channel and habitat adjacent to the lake. There was NAkm of habitat modelled upstream of the Highway 97 crossing 198666 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing with fine substrates and some habitat fragmentation due to subsurface/shallow flows within the heavily beaver influenced wetland type areas upstream. The large outlet drop and extensive length of the structure likely present a complete barrier to all fish species and life stages. The highway crossing (PSCIS 198666) was priliminarily ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement but electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density which may justify a higher priority for site remediation. It is also recommended that the the local McLeod Lake community be consulted to scope for information about the site and determine the importance of the stream to the community. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.13: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198714.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198687 was backwatered and embedded - ranking as a passable - according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.16). Water temperature was 7.4\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 6.8 and conductivity was 411uS/cm. Although the crossing appeared to be passable at the time of assessment it was noted that recent work had been completed to dredge out the stream channel upstream and downstream of the highway. This indicated that the structure currently in place was not appropriate for the site and that replacement of the crossing could be beneficial from a highway maintenance perspective as well as for reducing impacts on the potentially higher value habitat located immediately adjacent to the road (extensive gravels suitable for spawning). For this reason, a habitat confirmation assessment was completed to gatehr data on the value of the habitat upstream and downstream of the crossing. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.16: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198687.

The cost of the work is estimated at $NA. Conclusion There was 3.9km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 198687 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Although the crossing appeared to be passable at the time of assessment it was noted that recent work had been completed to dredge out the stream channel upstream and downstream of the highway. This indicated that the structure currently in place was not appropriate for the site and that replacement of the crossing could be beneficial from a highway maintenance perspective as well as for reducing impacts on the potentially higher value habitat located immediately adjacent to the road (extensive gravels suitable for spawning). For this reason, a habitat confirmation assessment was completed to gatehr data on the value of the habitat upstream and downstream of the crossing. PSCIS crossing 198687 on 42 Mile Creek was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. The project team plans to follow up with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to discuss the potential for replacement of the structure and to provide the necessary data to support the replacement if it is deemed helpful. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.17: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198687.

Crossing 198723 is located on a small spur road and crossing 198694 is located on Firth Lake FSR. The crossings are approximately 110m apart. The subject stream is just north of the Kerry Lake East 9 First Nation reserve. The subject stream flows into Altezega Creek approximately 300m downstream of the lower crossing (PSCIS 198723). Altezega Creek in turn flows into the Crooked River approximately 600m downstream of this confluence. A culvert crossing is present on the mainstem of Altezega Creek where crossed by the Hart Highway (PSCIS crossing 198664 located 430m upstream from the Crooked River) and was also inventoried as part of the 2023 field assessments. Background Upstream of the crossings no fish have previously been recorded however, within Altezega Creek - longnose sucker, burbot, and rainbow trout have been recorded upstream of the highway crossing with burbot captured near the highway in 2008 (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). A summary of habitat modelling outputs for crossing (198694) are presented in Table 5.18. The potential gains for 198723 can be assumed to be an additional 110m. A map of the watershed is provided in map attachment 093J.119. fpr::fpr_table_bcfp(sit = my_site2, scroll = F) Table 5.18: Summary of fish habitat modelling for PSCIS crossing 198694.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198723 was un-embedded and 75% backwatered. Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) the crossing is considered likely passable to all species and life stages at most flows due to the backwatering and a lack of an outlet drop (Table 5.19). At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198694 was un-embedded and not backwatered. Although ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) the crossing is considered potentially passable to most species and life stages at moderate to low flows due a lack of an outlet drop (Table 5.12). Water temperature was 10.2\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.2 and conductivity was 391uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.19: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 198723.

Although mapped in the freshwater atlas as crossing Firth Lake FSR, before flowing into Altezega Creek, the mapping is incorrect as the stream flows directly into Altezega Creek approximately 300m downstream. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198723 and downstream of 198694 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198723 for 110m to the location of 198694 (Figures 5.29 - 5.30). The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 1%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. Abundant gravels suitable for salmonid spawning were noted as present within the area surveyed. The habitat was rated as value for salmonid rearing. Stream Characteristics Upstream of 198694 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198694 for 650m (Figures 5.31 - 5.32). The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 2.7m, the average wetted width was 1.9m, and the average gradient was 2.8%. Small fish were spotted periodically throughout survey and significant blowdown created large woody debris cover - particularly for the first 250. Some deep pools suitable for overwintering were noted along with pockets of gravel suitable for spawning. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing habitat suitable for rearing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate As the purpose for the section of road on which 198723 is located is unclear (small section of road that begins on the transmission line but loops back to the FSR), deactivation of the road could be considered. If the road is necessary, an estimate of the cost for replacement of PSCIS crossing 198723 with a bridge (14m span) is $420,000. Replacement of crossing 198694 on Firth Lake FSR with a bridge (14m span) is estimated to cost $420,000 for a cost benefit of 10404.8 linear m/$1000 and 11445.2 m2/$1000. Conclusion There was an estimated 4.4km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 198694 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 198723 was ranked as a priority for proceeding to design for replacement as the crossing at the time of the survey had no outlet drop and was 75% backwatered. Crossing 198694 on Firth Lake FSR ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density which may justify a higher or lower priority for site remediation. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% dplyr::filter(Site == my_site | Site == my_site2) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &#39;, my_site, &#39; and &#39;, my_site2, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.21: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 198723 and 198694.
